"""Modulizing the app
Split the routes into modules i.e User, Business, Review

object `app` is created here so that each module can import it safely
and the __name__ variable will resolve to the correct package.

Its important to import the modules after the application object is created.

Why do this; it reduces lines of code within a single file
and its an easy read
